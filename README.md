# mnist_experiments

Initial attempt to investigate effects changing capacity of a classifier trained on MNIST.  It's not clear what reducing the accuracy from 99\% - easily done with a conv2d net with about 1k weights - to 98\% gets you.

Q: maybe the answer is more about generalization?  Test this out using qmnist.
